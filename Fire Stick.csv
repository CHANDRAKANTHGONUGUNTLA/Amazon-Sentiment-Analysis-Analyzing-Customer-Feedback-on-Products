At the time of ordering the product detail very categorically said that there is a One Year free subscription to Sony Liv, ZEE5 & Voot bundled along with the product. This was in the description section of the product that I ordered, hitch was very promptly delivered to me. Now when I enquired with Amazon helpline about how to activate the free subscription, the customer support denied any offer like this & now I am supposed to pay separately for these subscriptions. How I wish I had taken a screen shot of this & kept with me. At least would have saved myself from the misery of being denied of what was promised to begin with. I don‚Äôt know how that promotion appeared there, could have been a technical glitch on the part of Amazon but I am sure I bought this with the subscription which is now denied.

It was working fine till afternoon and after showing Software update in progress, it got stuck and never worked.I called up the Executive and after trying everything was asked to take it to nearby center. As the center is quite far, I didn't go, but ordered the third generation instead.I wrote to Amazon, if they are selling the product, then they should also provide after sales service. They can always charge. No issues.The person should visit home to rectify the problem. Trust me, there have been instances when some Electronics company sent a technician to home, though the equipment was worth only 2000 Rs.And here we are talking about an equipment costing Rs.4000 to Rs. 6000.How can an equipment stop working while updating software, still I can't get it. Is that deliberate so that Customer buys the new version?Not to say, I regret buying the third generation Firestick. It's a great experience. Great sound. It's a marvel.

Easy to setup, takes time though (especially for the update(s)).2. Runs on fire OS that is a fork of the Android operating system, so the appstore might not have everything, but you can sideload apps using the debug option (although, not recommended).3. Screencast worked with OnePlus and Mi phones.4. Voice search works on YouTube and other apps, but using mobile to search through on screen keyboard was easier.5. Bluetooth devices work, you can even add game controllers.6. Streaming quality is great even on 1080p, I thought koryo TV's are bad, but this device delivered a great experience.7.

But the email/notification never arrives. This is the frustrating part.3. Go to amazon.com/tv (the instruction appears on screen) from your PC or phone browser to provide the OTP. That's it.4. My firestick kept restarting (rebooting) throughout the setup process and I had to re-start the task many times. I thought mine was a faulty stick. Then I made sure the HDMI connection and power connection were firmly secured (tightened).

Had a poor experience with the first one as well.I bought the 1st gen Stick a few years ago - which lasted a couple of years and then it developed a personality. It would connect to wifi when it wanted and disconnected whenever it felt like it. Some days it would refuse to recognize the router (I have fiber FTH). And one fine day it stopped working completely.I bought the latest (2021) version of the First Stick to give it another try. On the first day, within 15 minutes of use, I started getting warnings from it - messages on the TV screen saying it was getting overheated (it is used in a room with an AC always on - with an ambient temperature at 25C or lower). I suspect this too will die in a few weeks of use.Sometimes you get what you pay for. Seems to be made of ultra cheap components. So no surprise that its performance is garbage. Avoid.IMHO, Roku is a far better value for money (my Roku from a decade ago is still working fine). You can play all the apps on it, just like the Fire Stick.

"R2TLC46984E1FN","Nitin Rege","Latest Update as of 27/12/21Have to reduce 2 stars I bought 2 Echo Studio speakers and paired with Fire TV Stick to get the DOlby Atmos effect, although the Eco Studio speakers support this Fire TV Stick does not support Dolby ATmos as claimed by Amazon. I have read each and every setting and had a conversation with many engineers form Amazon and got this confirmed. Please do not buy this if you want to pair it with any Dolby Atmos speakers. You will be disappointed like me.I have been using the Gen 1 Fire TV Stick with my non smart Panasonic TV since the launch of Fire TV Stick Gen 1. I recently purchased an Android TV from Panasonic and The OS was slow in responding and based on my experience with Fire TV Stick I thought of purchasing another Fire TV Stick to pair with this TV also because I am more familiar with Amazon Ecosystem then the Android / Google. It was a no brainer to go in for the Fire TV Stick with Dolby Atmos support because I plan to purchase Atmos Soundbar soon.The set up was easy like any other Amazon device however I was somehow not able to use the volume up down button with my TV. The workaround was to pair the bluetooth remote directly with my TV using bluetooth and then most of the functions worked and the TV could be switched off using the Fire TV remote but it could not be switched on again not sure why.The UI is simple and the response is faster then my Gen 1 stick also the boot time is much faster and hence I mentioned good device but not without flaws. Lot of R&D is still needed to be put in. Go for it if and only if you are keen on Fire TV Stick with Dolby Atmos Support else you would be better off buying the normal Fire TV Stick.I shall update the review once I pair the Atmos speaker with the Fire TV Stick.","Reviewed in India on 29 June 2021","Stay away if you want to buy for Dolby Atmos as this device does not support",2,"",0,"Fire TV Stick"

Using this for the past two weeks and most of the times I don't see any lag. Sometimes I feel delayed response time Of fire stick.What I like:1. I bought it for 2099 during Amazon sale. For this price, this device is worth for each rupee we spent (I was thinking to buy mi box 4k considering the price earlier)2. Navigation and set up is smooth3. Streaming quality is really awesome4. Controls to operate TV. I feel this is very important as my original tv remote id already broken5. Alexa voice search: I like this a lot6. Preset button: though I'm not using much, this is very useful featureWhat can be added:1. App Store not offering all the apps that are available in play store of other android streaming device. If all the apps available, some education related apps like seesaw for ex. can be used on tv. This device deserves 5 star but due to this point and next, only 4 star at the moment2. If possible, offering play store also would be great something similar to galaxy store and play store on Samsung smart phones3. Alexa voice search is useful to open apps and play movie or songs on same OTT. If we want to switch to other app and sub task inside, Alexa could not get it. For ex, if I want to open and play a song in youtube from other apps, it just opens youtube but not completing the rest of the commands. Google assistant is better in this aspect4. Experiance of screen mirroring is pathetic. But I don't use this as almost all the apps that I use are available in fire stick.

"RXJ9YGQ0MFH5J","Dharani kumar","I bought 2nd Gen fire tv stick.I found the hard way that for tv sticks work in Bluetooth for controlling the tv. The ir in the front is only for power on/off and volume controls.Issues:1. Bluetooth is power hungry, even new aaa battery goes out in 2 hours. ( So i created a habit of buying new batteries, use in fire tv and then use them in my other remotes.)2. I tried customer care they only tell to reset the remote everytime / or changeit battery, ya true. But actually remote eats up battery.3. Due to Bluetooth delay every press will hang up and get pressed randomly. Now with no options u keep the fire stick in store and buy a new Android tv with in built options and a infrared remote.That's what happened to me, hope this helps. If it happened to you try liking this review","Reviewed in India on 16 February 2022","It's a Bluetooth remote",1,"",1,"Fire TV Stick"

"R1U4YIGGOZBLA9","NK","Ordered this for 2399 on 1st day of prime day sale. The next day its price reduced to 2099 with coupons usage. I cancelled the previous order and ordered again. Not good to reduce price like that in just one day in same sale.1st good thing that I really liked is the black bars can be zoomed in from TV picture settings as it is an external device. So you can have full screen HD experience for all those YT,prime videos etc.. FYI if the apps are inbuilt in a smart TV, we cant zoom in like that.. 100 marks here as I always like to watch full screen without black bars.Coming to Alexa, its customized very well that even kids can use it. Bixby voice recognition in samsung smart TVs is one of the worst, it cant understand anything.Picture and Sound Clarity is amazing.All you need is good internet connection and you can forget about dish connections.","Reviewed in India on 2 August 2021","Elevated picture and sound clarity!!",5,"",1,"Fire TV Stick"

"R1CKU5482L5CM8","Sudhir Rawat","I have been using it from more than a month and it is performing flawlessly. First thing i liked was perfectly packaged thing. Remote batteries dongle, HDMI adapter, charging brick. Second thing setting up was easy and full of information and text. The remote controls the TV as well On/OFF my VU TV was listed and there were almost all brands of TV available even the names which you might have never heard off.  Easy to install and the DONGLE is dual band can receive 5G and 2.5G wifi network. Streaming is super smooth no lags. The device itself is very powerful compared to the new  budget smart TVs that have a low RAM/ Speed processor. So surfing channels and using Alexa is breeze. Overall i would highly recommend to get this thing if you have a smart TV,Now all you need is just the remote plus everything hides behind the TV so no one can ever tell that the TV is non smart and has been converted :) For a full videos review you can check youtube video on my channel lightsky motion Pictures","Reviewed in India on 5 June 2021","Simple Smooth Streaming Solution",5,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ghrtBMPZL.jpg","2","Fire TV Stick"

"R35YCBNE58XRV9","Karthik Bharadwaj","I have given a five star but will start from sad part. First I purchased firestick plus with zee5, voot and Sony LIV subscription. I got the delivery in 4 days. I signed in with my credentials. Everything worked super fine. The remote paired at first attempt itself. I was dilkush. But this wasn't last for long. I downloaded all files and checked pre subscribed packs. But the fate is it wasn't subscribed. Was asking to purchase it again. I contacted Amazon customer care. They gave few tips which doesn't seem to working with me. So I thought to return it and purchase without subscription (I could have kept it but since I paid 1k extra and was no use, thought of returning it). I ordered new one without subscriptions and got the item within 4 days(Thanks to Amazon delivery). Even now everything worked fine. I was worried on reading few reviews that the remote doesn't pair, but in my case it paired at very 1st attempt. Now there is diwali offer on few subscriptions where we get annual packs for low prices. Purchased zee5 for 500.So better not to waste on firetv plus and waste your time calling customer care(may work fine but it is just 2 lucky out of 10, where all 3 works good). Except purchase normal one and subscribe yourself which works all tasks in few minutes. Anyway the fire os is best and it is rocking . Dolby sound is plus point in this. Don't think twice just go for it without further thinking.","Reviewed in India on 10 October 2021","Dhoom Dhamaka Product",5,"","2","Fire TV Stick"

Came to rescue when that didnt work !Original ReviewI got 4k for almost two years and was very happy with it. That's used for my TV and it's butter smooth.  Later I wanted to buy one for projector. As it didn't support power/volume button on firestick, ordered the lite on launch day. Was happy with that too but that was not fast as 4k.I was eyeing on the new remote with 3rd gen stick and what a better time to purchase than this.Now coming to this device.Quick activation. If you are buying for yourself, please check the ""link to my account"" . No need of manual setup..Streaming quality is superb and it's in full hd resolution as you all knowAlexa integration - mic symbol replaced with alexa icon. It opens apps/channels without a problem. Have been using that for longRemote. Wish there was hotstar/sony instead of Amazon music. Prime video/Netflix buttons are very useful.Only surprise ::  I have an old 22"" Del monitor which got HDMI input. Unfortunately it didn't give output on that. I was in the impression that it works on any device with HDMI inputs. As Amazon gives you a no question asked return in 10 days, you need not worry.I used mi stick and mibox before. There is a huge difference between them and firestick devices.Prices are never been better.

My major 2 cons are.  a). There is no instructions on how it starts.  It was prompting me to push a 3 dot button on my remote which was not there.  I randomly clicked some buttons and it started.  b). In the Amazon app in Android tv there is a move video button which shows the scenes much like YouTube.  Could not do that in fire stick.  But other than that, the speed is really good.  Will be checking more and updating.  Alexa assistant is a bit of a hit and miss and in my case more miss.  This inspite of me having an Alexa at home and that is working well.  So this was surprising.

Takes about 15 minutes to update your fire stick and finish set up.The updated 2021 version comes with the new remote with which you can control everything, so much so after buying and setting this up you won't require your original TV remote again.The Alexa app does a decent job of recognising your voice and following the command.Stream quality is excellent.The only drawback or inefficiency is in the live TV button given in the remote and the option itself.It's meant to pull all the live TV channels from your subscribed apps and display them together so that you don't have to open the apps separately.But in spite of 'syncing' multiple times, fire TV couldn't sync and show the channels from the apps","Reviewed in India on 5 October 2021","Perfect tool to convert TV into Smart TV",4,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71b5qHj1y7L.jpg",0,"Fire TV Stick"

"R4TG73N2FZ6XT","jitendra","Must buy if you find it under 2500 again.I got free prime subscription for 3 months as well.Few points:1. Always purchase this version. Dont buy lite version. I returned lite version. Reason is bluetooth audio. Lite version has very low bluetooth audio and you can not even hear dialogues.  This version of sticks has volume controls for bluetooth devices with latest firmware update so you can use fire stick remote to control your bluetooth headphone/soundbar audio. Trust me this helps a lot. Please update firestick bios to use this feature.2. Voice recognition on this version is very great and works on all apps.3. If you are connecting with aux cable or want to is TV Audio, please use PCM onlyoption fron audio settings on stick.4. If your bluetooth headphone/ soundbar has Bluetooth 5.0 then there is no lag in audio while watching movies. You can blindly purchase this stick as this has bluetooth version 5.0.  Other sticks like Mi and realme has bluetooth 4.0 which results in audio lag.I am using it with projector with soundbar and I am getting true theatre like feeling no doubt.","Reviewed in India on 15 November 2021","Bluetooth audio, voice recognition, streaming great",5,"",1,"Fire TV Stick"

Only problem is that it didn't work fully with my Noble Skiodo TV - the volume and power buttons didn't integrate with the TV's software. Amazon should let customers know beforehand which TVs it works with. I saw Noble Skiodo in the list of TVs while setting up this remote but somehow it was not able to download the TV control software from their website. Noble Skiodo TV model that I had is no longer available on Amazon so that may be responsible for lack of software.
